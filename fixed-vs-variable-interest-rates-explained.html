    <h1>Fixed vs Variable Interest Rates Explained</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      Understand how fixed and variable interest rates work, their advantages and risks,
      and how to think about them in loans, mortgages, and savings.
    </p>

    <p>
      Interest rates affect almost every financial decision — from loans and mortgages
      to savings accounts and investments. One of the most common choices people face is
      whether to use a <strong>fixed</strong> or <strong>variable</strong> interest rate.
    </p>

    <p>
      This guide explains the differences in simple terms, using clear USD examples and
      avoiding technical jargon.
    </p>

    <h2>What Is a Fixed Interest Rate?</h2>
    <p>
      A <strong>fixed interest rate</strong> stays the same for the entire term of a loan
      or investment. Once set, it does not change — even if market rates rise or fall.
    </p>

    <h3>Key characteristics of fixed rates</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Predictable payments</li>
      <li>Stable budgeting</li>
      <li>No exposure to rate increases</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="example">
      <strong>Example:</strong><br />
      You take a $200,000 mortgage at a fixed 6% interest rate for 30 years.
      Your monthly payment remains the same every month, regardless of market changes.
    </div>

    <h2>What Is a Variable Interest Rate?</h2>
    <p>
      A <strong>variable interest rate</strong> can change over time. It is usually tied
      to a benchmark rate, such as a central bank rate or market index.
    </p>

    <h3>Key characteristics of variable rates</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Payments can go up or down</li>
      <li>Often starts lower than fixed rates</li>
      <li>Higher uncertainty over time</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="example">
      <strong>Example:</strong><br />
      You take a $200,000 mortgage with a variable rate starting at 5%.
      If market rates rise to 6.5%, your monthly payment increases accordingly.
    </div>

    <h2>Fixed vs Variable: Side-by-Side Comparison</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Stability:</strong> Fixed rates offer certainty; variable rates fluctuate</li>
      <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Fixed rates reduce risk; variable rates carry uncertainty</li>
      <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Variable rates may benefit from falling rates</li>
      <li><strong>Planning:</strong> Fixed rates are easier for long-term budgeting</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When Might a Fixed Rate Make Sense?</h2>
    <p>
      Fixed interest rates are often preferred when:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You value predictable monthly payments</li>
      <li>You are on a tight budget</li>
      <li>Interest rates are relatively low</li>
      <li>You plan to hold the loan long-term</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When Might a Variable Rate Make Sense?</h2>
    <p>
      Variable rates may be considered when:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You expect rates to fall or stay low</li>
      <li>You plan to repay or refinance early</li>
      <li>You can tolerate payment fluctuations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
    <p>
      A common myth is that variable rates are always cheaper. While they may start lower,
      rising rates can quickly erase early savings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another misconception is that fixed rates are “safer” in all cases. Safety depends
      on personal cash flow, time horizon, and risk tolerance.
    </p>

    <h2>How Interest Rates Affect Total Cost</h2>
    <p>
      Even small rate differences can significantly change the total amount paid over time.
      This is why comparing scenarios with calculators can be helpful.
    </p>

    <div class="example">
      <strong>Example:</strong><br />
      A 1% increase on a long-term loan can add tens of thousands of dollars in interest
      over the life of the loan.
    </div>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      There is no universal “best” choice between fixed and variable interest rates.
      The right option depends on your goals, time horizon, and tolerance for uncertainty.
    </p>

    <p>
      Understanding how each rate works helps you make more informed and confident
      financial decisions.

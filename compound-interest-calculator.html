      <h2>What Is a Compound Interest Calculator?</h2>
      <p>
        A compound interest calculator estimates how your money can grow over time when interest is added to both your
        original deposit and the interest you’ve already earned. This “interest on interest” effect is the reason
        long-term saving and investing can accelerate after enough time passes.
      </p>
      <p>
        To use this calculator, enter your starting amount, optional monthly contributions, an annual interest rate,
        and a time period. Then choose how often interest compounds (monthly, daily, etc.) and click
        <strong>Calculate</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Use This Calculator</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Initial amount:</strong> what you start with today.</li>
        <li><strong>Monthly contribution:</strong> how much you add each month (optional).</li>
        <li><strong>Annual interest rate:</strong> the expected yearly return (or savings rate).</li>
        <li><strong>Years:</strong> your time horizon.</li>
        <li><strong>Compounding frequency:</strong> how often interest is applied (annually, monthly, weekly, daily).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The results show your estimated <strong>final balance</strong>, how much you contributed in total, and how much
        <strong>interest was earned</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        <strong>Deposit timing assumption:</strong> Monthly contributions are modeled as deposits once per month (at the end of each month).
        Interest is applied according to your selected compounding frequency.
      </p>

      <h2>Compound Interest Formula Breakdown</h2>
      <p>The classic compound interest formula is:</p>
      <p><strong>FV = P × (1 + r / n)<sup>(n × t)</sup></strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>FV</strong> = future value (ending balance)</li>
        <li><strong>P</strong> = principal (initial amount)</li>
        <li><strong>r</strong> = annual interest rate (as a decimal)</li>
        <li><strong>n</strong> = compounding periods per year (12 monthly, 365 daily, 1 yearly)</li>
        <li><strong>t</strong> = years</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you add monthly contributions, each deposit has its own time to compound. That’s why consistent
        contributions can increase the final value dramatically over long horizons.
      </p>

      <h2>Example Scenarios</h2>

      <h3>Example 1: $10,000 at 7% for 25 years (no contributions)</h3>
      <p>
        A one-time deposit can still grow significantly with time. At 7% annually for 25 years, $10,000 can grow to
        roughly <strong>$54,000+</strong> depending on compounding frequency.
      </p>

      <h3>Example 2: $10,000 + $200/month at 7% for 25 years</h3>
      <p>
        Adding a consistent monthly contribution often matters more than minor differences in compounding frequency.
        In many scenarios, this can push the final value to <strong>$190,000+</strong> over 25 years.
      </p>

      <h2>Annual vs. Monthly vs. Daily Compounding</h2>
      <p>
        Compounding more frequently means interest is applied more often. That can slightly increase the final balance,
        but for most people the bigger drivers are <strong>time</strong> and <strong>consistent monthly contributions</strong>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Annual compounding:</strong> simplest model (interest added once per year).</li>
        <li><strong>Monthly compounding:</strong> common for many savings products.</li>
        <li><strong>Daily compounding:</strong> sometimes used by banks; the difference vs monthly is usually modest.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Rule of 72</h2>
      <p>
        The Rule of 72 estimates how long it takes to double your money:
        <strong>72 ÷ annual rate (%)</strong> ≈ years to double.
      </p>
      <p>
        At 6%, doubling takes about <strong>12 years</strong> (72 ÷ 6 = 12). This is a quick mental shortcut — not an exact
        forecast — but it helps build intuition.
      </p>

      <h2>Inflation and “Real” Buying Power</h2>
      <p>
        This calculator shows results in <strong>nominal dollars</strong> (not inflation-adjusted). Inflation reduces
        purchasing power over time, so the “real” value of the ending balance may be lower.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        To estimate real buying power, compare against an inflation assumption using the
        <a href="https://financecalccenter.com/inflation-calculator.html">Inflation Calculator</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mixing APR and APY:</strong> APY includes compounding; APR may not.</li>
        <li><strong>Using unrealistic rates:</strong> compare conservative and optimistic scenarios.</li>
        <li><strong>Ignoring fees and taxes:</strong> they reduce what actually compounds.</li>
        <li><strong>Stopping contributions too early:</strong> consistency often beats short-term intensity.</li>
        <li><strong>Forgetting inflation:</strong> nominal gains aren’t the same as real purchasing power.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>Is this compound interest calculator accurate?</h3>
      <p>
        It provides an estimate based on the values you enter. Real-world results may differ due to fees, taxes,
        changing interest rates, and market performance.
      </p>

      <h3>Are monthly contributions added monthly even if I choose daily compounding?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Contributions are treated as monthly deposits. Compounding frequency controls how interest accrues, but
        deposits occur monthly in this model.
      </p>

      <h3>Does this calculator include inflation?</h3>
      <p>
        No. Results are shown in nominal dollars and do not adjust for inflation. Use the
        <a href="https://financecalccenter.com/inflation-calculator.html">Inflation Calculator</a> to estimate real buying power.
      </p>

      <h3>What interest rate should I use?</h3>
      <p>
        For a savings account, use the rate your bank provides. For investments, try a few conservative long-term rates
        to compare scenarios rather than relying on short-term performance.
      </p>

      <h3>Does compounding frequency matter a lot?</h3>
      <p>
        More frequent compounding can slightly increase the final balance—especially over long horizons. But time and
        consistent monthly contributions usually have a bigger effect.
      </p>

      <h3>What is the Rule of 72?</h3>
      <p>
        It’s a quick estimate of how long it takes to double your money: 72 divided by your annual rate (in percent)
        gives an approximate number of years.
      </p>

      <h3>Why is my result different from a bank or brokerage projection?</h3>
      <p>
        Different tools may assume different deposit timing, use APY vs APR, include fees, taxes, or use variable rates.
        This calculator uses a simplified fixed-rate model for clarity.
      </p>

      <h3>Can compound interest apply to debt as well?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Many credit cards and some loans compound interest, which can cause balances to grow faster than expected.
        If you want to see how loan payments and total interest work, try the

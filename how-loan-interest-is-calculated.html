        This guide breaks down <strong>how interest is calculated on loans</strong> using clear steps and simple math.

      <article class="card" aria-label="How loan interest is calculated article">
        <p class="note">
          Educational content only (not financial advice). Lenders may use different conventions (daily interest, rounding, fee rules).
          Use the calculators linked below to test your own “what if” scenarios.
        </p>

        <h2 id="quick-definition">1) The two things that drive interest</h2>
        <p>
          For most consumer loans, interest is fundamentally driven by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Principal (balance):</strong> how much you currently owe.</li>
          <li><strong>Rate:</strong> how much interest is charged over time (often expressed as APR).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When you make payments, your balance changes—so the interest you owe in the future changes too.
          That’s why a payment schedule (amortization) matters.
        </p>

        <h2 id="step-by-step">2) Step-by-step: calculate one month of interest</h2>
        <p>
          The simplest way to estimate monthly loan interest is:
        </p>

        <div class="formula" role="note" aria-label="Monthly interest formula">
          Monthly interest ≈ Balance × (APR ÷ 12)
        </div>

        <p>
          Example: You owe <strong>$8,000</strong> at <strong>19.99% APR</strong>.
          The estimated monthly rate is <strong>0.1999 ÷ 12 ≈ 0.016658</strong>.
        </p>

        <div class="formula" role="note" aria-label="Monthly interest example">
          Monthly interest ≈ 8,000 × 0.016658 ≈ 133.26
        </div>

        <p>
          So, roughly <strong>$133.26</strong> of interest accrues that month (estimate).
          If your payment is <strong>$250</strong>, then the remaining part goes to principal:
        </p>

        <div class="formula" role="note" aria-label="Payment split example">
          Principal paid ≈ Payment − Interest ≈ 250 − 133.26 ≈ 116.74
        </div>

        <p>
          And your new balance is about:
        </p>

        <div class="formula" role="note" aria-label="New balance example">
          New balance ≈ 8,000 − 116.74 ≈ 7,883.26
        </div>

        <p>
          Next month, interest is calculated on the new balance (which is lower),
          so interest is slightly lower—assuming the rate stays the same.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2 id="amortization">3) What amortization really means</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Amortization</strong> is just the process of paying down a loan over time with scheduled payments.
          Each payment is split into:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Interest:</strong> the cost of borrowing for that period</li>
          <li><strong>Principal:</strong> the amount that reduces your balance</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          On typical fixed-payment loans, early payments feel “interest-heavy” because your balance is highest at the start.
          As the balance falls, the interest portion usually decreases and the principal portion increases.
        </p>

        <h3 id="simple-table">Mini example: first 3 months (simplified)</h3>
        <p>
          Using the earlier example (<span class="kbd">$8,000</span>, <span class="kbd">19.99% APR</span>, <span class="kbd">$250</span> payment),
          the first few months might look like this (rounded):
        </p>

        <table class="table" aria-label="Amortization mini table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Month</th>
              <th>Starting Balance</th>
              <th>Interest (est.)</th>
              <th>Principal (est.)</th>
              <th>Ending Balance</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>1</td>
              <td>$8,000.00</td>
              <td>$133.26</td>
              <td>$116.74</td>
              <td>$7,883.26</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>2</td>
              <td>$7,883.26</td>
              <td>$131.31</td>
              <td>$118.69</td>
              <td>$7,764.57</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>3</td>
              <td>$7,764.57</td>
              <td>$129.33</td>
              <td>$120.67</td>
              <td>$7,643.90</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
          Important: real schedules can differ due to <strong>daily interest</strong>, payment timing, rounding, and lender rules.
          But the logic stays the same: interest is computed on a balance, and the rest of the payment reduces principal.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2 id="daily-interest">4) Monthly vs daily interest (why results differ)</h2>
        <p>
          Some loans—especially certain personal loans, lines of credit, or older loan products—compute interest daily:
        </p>

        <div class="formula" role="note" aria-label="Daily interest formula">
          Daily interest ≈ Balance × (APR ÷ 365) × Number of days
        </div>

        <p>
          That means if you pay earlier in the month, you might reduce the interest slightly because the balance is lower for more days.
          (That’s one reason “payment timing” matters in some calculators.)
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2 id="negative-amortization">5) The critical check: is your payment even enough?</h2>
        <p>
          A simple sanity check:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>If your <strong>monthly payment ≤ monthly interest</strong>, your balance won’t shrink (and can even grow).</li>
          <li>To pay down the debt, the payment must exceed the interest amount (at least most months).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This is called <strong>negative amortization</strong> (or “not reaching payoff”).
          It’s common with low credit card payments or some loan structures.
        </p>

        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2 id="fixed-payment">6) How fixed monthly payments are determined (high level)</h2>
        <p>
          For a standard amortizing loan (like many auto loans and mortgages), lenders often set a fixed monthly payment that fully pays off the loan by the end of the term.
          The exact payment formula is based on the present value of an annuity.
        </p>

        <p>
          You don’t need to memorize the formula to use it correctly, but conceptually:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Higher principal → higher payment</li>
          <li>Higher rate → higher payment</li>
          <li>Longer term → lower payment (but usually more total interest)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>

        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2 id="extra-payments">7) Extra payments: why they work so well</h2>
        <p>
          Extra payments help because they reduce your balance sooner. Since interest is based on the balance,
          reducing the balance earlier tends to reduce future interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is easiest to see on revolving or high-APR debt:
          even small extra payments can meaningfully shorten payoff time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Try “what if I pay +$25/month?”:

        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2 id="common-mistakes">8) Common mistakes when calculating loan interest</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mixing APR and interest rate:</strong> APR can include fees; nominal rate may differ.</li>
          <li><strong>Forgetting compounding conventions:</strong> some products use daily interest, others monthly.</li>
          <li><strong>Rounding differences:</strong> lenders may round interest or payments in specific ways.</li>
          <li><strong>Assuming “payment = principal paid”:</strong> interest comes first on most loans.</li>
          <li><strong>Comparing offers only by payment:</strong> total interest depends on term and rate too.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>

        <h3>Is interest calculated on the original loan amount?</h3>
        <p>
          Most amortizing loans calculate interest on the <strong>remaining balance</strong>. Some products can have different rules,
          but balance-based interest is the typical behavior.
        </p>

        <h3>Why does the interest portion go down over time?</h3>
        <p>
          Because interest is calculated on the balance. As principal is paid down, the balance falls and interest tends to fall too
          (with a fixed rate).
        </p>

        <h3>What’s the fastest way to reduce total interest?</h3>
        <p>
          Mathematically, reducing balance earlier reduces future interest. That can happen via a lower rate, a shorter term, or extra payments.
          You can test the “extra payment” effect with the debt payoff tool linked above.

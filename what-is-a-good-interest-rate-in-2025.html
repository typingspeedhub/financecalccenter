    <section class="card" aria-label="Main article">
      <p>
        There’s no single number that is “the” good interest rate for everyone in 2025. A good rate depends on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Whether you are <strong>saving or borrowing</strong></li>
        <li>Your <strong>credit score</strong> and income</li>
        <li>The <strong>type of product</strong> (savings, mortgage, credit card, personal loan)</li>
        <li>Current <strong>market conditions and inflation</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Instead of chasing one magic number, it’s better to understand the <strong>ranges</strong> and know when an offer is
        clearly <strong>good, average, or expensive</strong>.
      </p>

      <div class="tip">
        Quick rule of thumb:
        <br />
        A rate is usually “good” if it’s among the <strong>top tier of offers</strong> for your credit profile and product type —
        not just a little better than your bank’s default.
      </div>

      <h2>Step 1: APR vs APY – Know What You’re Looking At</h2>
      <p>
        Before comparing numbers, you need to know whether you’re looking at:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>APR (Annual Percentage Rate)</strong> – mostly used for <strong>loans & credit cards</strong></li>
        <li><strong>APY (Annual Percentage Yield)</strong> – mostly used for <strong>savings and deposits</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        APR ignores compounding. APY includes compounding, so it shows the <strong>real annual return</strong> on your savings.
      </p>

      <h2>What Is a Good Interest Rate for Savings in 2025?</h2>
      <p>
        For savings in 2025, the main comparison is usually between:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Traditional bank savings accounts (often low APY)</li>
        <li><strong>High-yield savings accounts</strong> (online or promotional accounts)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In many rate environments, high-yield savings accounts pay several times more than traditional accounts.
        For example, if a big brick-and-mortar bank is paying around <strong>0.5% APY</strong>, a competitive online high-yield
        savings account might pay several times that amount.
      </p>

      <h3>What usually counts as “good” for savings?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Your rate is close to the <strong>top high-yield savings offers</strong> available online.</li>
        <li>You’re earning clearly more than “standard” bank savings rates.</li>
        <li>The account has <strong>FDIC/NCUA protection</strong> (or your country’s equivalent) and no strange conditions.</li>
      </ul>

      </p>

      <h3>How inflation changes what’s “good”</h3>
      <p>
        If inflation is higher than your savings rate, your money’s <strong>purchasing power is still shrinking</strong>, even though
        the dollar amount is growing.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if your account earns 3% APY but inflation runs at 4%, your <em>real return</em> is roughly −1%.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        You can experiment with this using the
        <a href="inflation-calculator.html">Inflation Calculator</a> and

      <h2>What Is a Good Mortgage Rate in 2025?</h2>
      <p>
        Mortgage rates depend heavily on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your <strong>credit score</strong></li>
        <li>Down payment size</li>
        <li>Loan type (fixed vs adjustable)</li>
        <li>Loan term (e.g., 15-year vs 30-year)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A “good” mortgage rate in 2025 is generally one that is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Competitive with other offers for your <strong>credit tier</strong></li>
        <li>Lower than the national average for that loan type and term</li>
        <li>Offered with <strong>reasonable closing costs</strong> (no hidden junk fees)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to compare mortgage offers</h3>
      <p>
        Don’t just look at the headline rate. Check:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>APR</strong> on the mortgage estimate (includes some fees)</li>
        <li>Whether the rate is <strong>fixed for the full term</strong> or adjustable</li>
        <li>Points or upfront costs to “buy down” the rate</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="muted">
        Use the <a href="mortgage-calculator.html">Mortgage Calculator</a> to test different rates, terms, and property tax assumptions.
      </p>

      <div class="tip">
        Small rate differences add up:
        <br />
        A difference of just <strong>0.5 percentage points</strong> on a 30-year mortgage can mean paying tens of thousands of dollars
        more or less over the life of the loan.
      </div>

      <hr />

      <h2>What Is a Good Rate on a Personal Loan in 2025?</h2>
      <p>
        Personal loan rates vary widely because they’re often unsecured (no collateral).
        Your credit score, income, and debt-to-income ratio play a big role.
      </p>

      <h3>Rough way to judge if an offer is “good”</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Your rate is <strong>among the lowest</strong> you can get with your credit profile.</li>
        <li>You’ve compared offers from <strong>at least 2–3 lenders</strong>.</li>
        <li>Fees are transparent and the APR is clearly disclosed.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Very low rates are usually reserved for borrowers with <strong>excellent credit</strong> and stable income.
        If your rate is much higher, focus first on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Improving your credit score</li>
        <li>Paying down other debts to lower your <strong>debt-to-income ratio</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p class="muted">

      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>What Is a Good Interest Rate on Credit Cards?</h2>
      <p>
        Credit card APRs are typically much higher than other forms of consumer debt.
        Because of that, the most important question is often:
      </p>
      <p><strong>“Will I carry a balance?”</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>If you <strong>pay in full every month</strong>: the interest rate matters less; rewards and benefits matter more.</li>
        <li>If you <strong>carry a balance</strong>: the APR is critical, and high-interest credit card debt becomes very expensive.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What usually counts as “good” on a card?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>For good–excellent credit: an APR toward the <strong>lower end</strong> of the card’s advertised range.</li>
        <li>For average credit: still compare multiple cards; avoid the very high-end penalty APRs.</li>
        <li>0% intro APR offers can be powerful if used responsibly for <strong>short-term balance transfers</strong> and paid off on time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Decide if Your Rate Is Good (Simple Checklist)</h2>
      <p>For any product in 2025, walk through this quick checklist:</p>

      <h3>1. Compare to similar products</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Check rates for the <strong>same type</strong> of account or loan (don’t compare savings APY to CD rates, for example).</li>
        <li>Look at offers for people with a <strong>similar credit profile</strong>, not just the teaser “as low as” number.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Look beyond the headline rate</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>For savings: APY, fees, and withdrawal limits.</li>
        <li>For loans: APR, fees, prepayment penalties, and term length.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Ask: “What does this do in real dollars over time?”</h3>
      <p>
        A rate that looks small on paper can have a big impact over years.
        That’s why running the numbers is so powerful.

      </p>

      <h3>4. Consider inflation and your goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>For savings: focus on keeping pace with (or beating) inflation while staying within your risk comfort zone.</li>
        <li>For investing: consider the <strong>average stock market return</strong> over long periods as a reference point.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What If Your Rate Isn’t Good?</h2>
      <p>
        If you realize your current rate isn’t competitive for 2025, don’t panic — focus on practical steps:
      </p>

      <h3>For savings</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Compare a few <strong>high-yield savings accounts</strong> and switch if the difference is meaningful.</li>
        <li>Avoid chasing tiny differences that don’t matter after taxes and inflation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>For loans & credit cards</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Improve your <strong>credit score</strong> (on-time payments, lower utilization).</li>
        <li>Consider <strong>refinancing</strong> or consolidating high-interest debt.</li>
        <li>Use a payoff strategy (Snowball or Avalanche) to reduce balances faster.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="tip">
        The exact number matters less than your <strong>overall plan</strong>.
        A slightly worse rate with a strong payoff or savings strategy often beats a great rate with no plan.

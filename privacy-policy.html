      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="muted">Last updated: December 2025</p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>FinanceCalcCenter</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use
        <a href="https://financecalccenter.com/">financecalccenter.com</a> and our online financial calculators.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using this website, you agree to the practices described in this policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the site.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <h3>1.1. Non-personal usage data</h3>
      <p>
        We use analytics tools (such as Google Analytics) to collect basic, non-personal information about how visitors use the site, for example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pages visited and time spent on each page</li>
        <li>Browser type, device type, and operating system</li>
        <li>Approximate geographic region (country or city)</li>
        <li>Referring websites or links</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This data is aggregated and does not directly identify you. It helps us understand which calculators and guides are most useful so we can improve the site.
      </p>

      <h3>1.2. Server logs</h3>
      <p>
        Like most websites, our hosting provider may automatically log technical information such as IP address, browser type, and timestamps for security and maintenance purposes.
      </p>

      <h3>1.3. Information you choose to provide</h3>
      <p>
        In general, you can use FinanceCalcCenter without creating an account or providing personal details.
        If you contact us directly (for example, by email), we may receive your name, email address, and the content of your message.
        This information is used only to respond to your inquiry.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        We use cookies and similar technologies to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand how visitors use the site (analytics cookies)</li>
        <li>Improve performance and usability</li>
        <li>Support potential advertising features (such as Google AdSense)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can control or delete cookies through your browser settings. If you disable cookies, some features of the website may not work as intended.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Analytics (Google Analytics)</h2>
      <p>
        We use Google Analytics to measure traffic and usage patterns. Google Analytics uses cookies and collects data as described in
        Google’s own privacy policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can learn more about how Google uses data from partner sites by visiting Google’s policies pages.
        Many browsers and tools also allow you to opt out of Google Analytics if you prefer.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Advertising and Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        In the future, FinanceCalcCenter <strong>may display ads</strong> using third-party advertising networks such as Google AdSense.
        These third parties may use cookies or similar technologies to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Measure ad performance</li>
        <li>Prevent fraud and abuse</li>
        <li>Show more relevant ads based on your browsing activity</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Any such advertising will be subject to the policies of the respective providers. You can typically manage ad personalisation through your browser
        settings or your Google account settings (if applicable in your region).
      </p>

      <h2>5. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintain and improve the website and calculators</li>
        <li>Analyze usage trends and performance</li>
        <li>Detect and prevent technical issues or abuse</li>
        <li>Respond to your messages and support requests</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not sell</strong> your personal information.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may share data with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Service providers</strong> – such as hosting, analytics, or security services, who help us operate the site and are expected to protect the data they process.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal or security reasons</strong> – if required to comply with the law, respond to legal requests, or protect our rights, users, or property.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. International Visitors</h2>
      <p>
        FinanceCalcCenter may be accessed from many countries. By using the site, you understand that information may be processed in countries that may have different data protection laws than your own.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Your Choices and Controls</h2>
      <p>You may be able to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Disable or clear cookies in your browser settings</li>
        <li>Use tools or browser add-ons to opt out of analytics tracking</li>
        <li>Contact us if you would like to update or delete information you have directly provided (for example via email)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Depending on your location, you may have additional rights under local data protection laws (such as rights to access, correct, or delete your personal data).
        If you wish to exercise these rights, you can contact us using the details below.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain analytics and log data for as long as reasonably necessary to operate, secure, and improve the website, or as required by our service providers.
        Information you send us directly (for example via email) may be kept for as long as needed to handle your request and maintain appropriate records.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to help protect the site and any information we handle.  
        However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        FinanceCalcCenter is intended for general audiences and is not specifically directed at children under the age of 13.
        We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information,
        please contact us so we can remove it.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Third-Party Links</h2>
      <p>
        Our site may contain links to third-party websites. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those sites.
        We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any websites you visit.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or applicable laws.
        When we do, we will change the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your continued use of the website after any changes means you accept the updated policy.
      </p>
